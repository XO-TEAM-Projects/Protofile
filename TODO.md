# TODO: Make Page Responsive Across All Screen Sizes

## Approved Plan

- Convert fixed pixel widths/heights/paddings to relative units (%, vw, em) for scalability.
- Make all images responsive (max-width: 100%, height: auto).
- Adjust layouts: Stack nav vertically on small screens, make hero section column-based, ensure grids adapt.
- Add comprehensive media queries for breakpoints: 1200px, 900px, 750px, 450px, 300px, 200px.
- Ensure text sizes, gaps, and spacings scale appropriately.
